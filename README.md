## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mon SaldaÃ±a. 

I'm a student of genomic sciences.

### UNAM ENES Juriquilla.

I'm passionate about science and its potential to understand the world around us. 

I firmly believe that science is by and for the people.

I love listening to music.
I write all the time :)
I do it everything... sometimes jj. 

**Always open to interdisciplinary collaborations**
